= Active Merchant

This library is supposed to aid in creating e-commerce software in ruby. 
In the future we want to support all "good" payment gateways. 

This library is the foundation of commerce for http://www.shopify.com. 

== Supported Gateways

 * Bogus -- your trusty test gateway which does nothing. Great for testing your app!
 * Authorized.net -- http://www.authorize.net/
 * Moneris (canada) -- http://www.moneris.com/
 * TrustCommerce -- http://www.trustcommerce.com/ . Requires the tclink ruby library from http://www.trustcommerce.com/tclink.html. Otherwise it will not be loaded.

== Download

Currently this library is available with svn from:

  svn://vault.jadedpixel.com/active_merchant/trunk/active_merchant
